# Vagrant

COnfigured a default VM using the vgrant cloud box for the VM to spin up 
Edited the vagrantfile to configure public and private network. Also, synced and provisioned the VM. 
Later, We spinned up multiple VMs by following the steps given in the offical document for Vagrant.
This was a fun lab. You can go check out my vagrantfile for configuration.
